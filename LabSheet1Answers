Lab sheet 1 

1 Create a function as a variable (function expression) that prints ‘Hello World’ to console
and another function which accepts a variable. The argument passed to the second
function should be executed as a function inside the body. Call the second function
passing the first function as the argument. Check the output.


 function a() {
      console.log("Hello world \n");
    }

    a()

   var o=function () {
      console.log("Hello im object calliing \n");
    }

    o()
    



3Understand the ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript.
● Declare a global variable named vehicleName in the window object
● Declare a method named printVehicleName to print out the vehicle name
● Declare an object named Vehicle(using object literal notation) which have a
variable called vehicleName and declare a function named getVehicleName and
assign it with the printVehicleName
● Execute the printVehicleName function and the getVehicleName functions to see
the results
● Correct the getVehicleName to print out the global variable vehicleName using
the this keyword




var vehicleName="Bus"

function printVehicleName(){
console.log(this.vehicleName)
}

var Vehicle={
vehicleName:"Car",
getVehicleName:printVehicleName}
 } 
 Vehicle.getVehicleName()
 prinVehicleName()
 
 
 
 
 
  4. Create a separate function using JavaScript closure which accepts the tax percentage and
returns a function which accepts the amount and returns the amount after adding tax
percentage. Try adding tax percentage to ‘this’ object and check if it works




  function calc(tax){
  function taxAmount(amount){
  return amount+tax;}
  return taxAmount;
  }
  var v=calc(10);
  consol.log(v(5));
  
 
 
 
    
    5 . Write a function to call GitHub API (https://api.github.com/users) and get users and
return the users to the caller.




function fetchUsers() {
    fetch('https://api.github.com/users').then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    }).then(function (json) {
        console.log(json)
    });

}


fetchUsers();
